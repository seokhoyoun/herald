## Project Structure

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just an extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

Inside your project, you'll see the following directory structure:

```
├── public/
│   └── ...
└── src/
    ├── components/
    │   └── ...
    └── routes/
        └── ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory-based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

## Add Integrations and deployment

Use the `npm run qwik add` command to add additional integrations. Some examples of integrations includes: Cloudflare, Netlify or Express Server, and the [Static Site Generator (SSG)](https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/guides/static-site-generation/).

```shell
npm run qwik add # or `yarn qwik add`
```

## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). The `dev` command will server-side render (SSR) the output during development.

```shell
npm start # or `yarn start`
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite may request a significant number of `.js` files. This does not represent a Qwik production build.

### Access from Tailscale

`npm start` is already configured to bind to all interfaces (including `tailscale0`):

```shell
npm start
```

Then open the app from another Tailnet device:

```text
http://<this-machine-tailscale-ip>:5173
```

## Supabase (Local)

1. Install Docker Desktop (WSL integration enabled) and Supabase CLI.
2. Start local Supabase services:

```shell
npm run supabase:start
```

3. Check local connection values:

```shell
npm run supabase:status
```

4. Set `.env.local` with local values:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon key from supabase status>
```

5. If you access the app from Tailscale or another host, add that exact origin to auth redirect allow-lists.
- Local Supabase: `supabase/config.toml` -> `[auth].additional_redirect_urls`
- Hosted Supabase: Dashboard -> Authentication -> URL Configuration -> Redirect URLs

6. Run the app:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Useful commands:

```shell
npm run supabase:db:reset
npm run supabase:stop
```

## Preview

The preview command will create a production build of the client modules, a production build of `src/entry.preview.tsx`, and run a local server. The preview server is only for convenience to preview a production build locally and should not be used as a production server.

```shell
npm run preview # or `yarn preview`
```

## Production

The production build will generate client and server modules by running both client and server build commands. The build command will use Typescript to run a type check on the source code.

```shell
npm run build # or `yarn build`
```

## Static Site Generator (Node.js)

Be sure to configure your server to serve very long cache headers for the `build/**/*.js` files.

Typically you'd set the `Cache-Control` header for those files to `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.

```shell
npm run build.server
```

## Testing

This project uses Node's built-in `node:test` runner.

```shell
npm test
```

## Static Site Generator (Node.js)
